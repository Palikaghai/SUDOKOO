# BRIEF INTRO..
 Imagine you have a big magic square that's like a playground divided into nine little square playgrounds inside it. 
 Each playground is three by three, just like tic-tac-toe but way bigger and with numbers!!

# TECH STACK
* Python 3.8+
* Backtracking algorithm (O(1) avg for 9x9)
* Easy to extend: Add GUI with Tkinter/Streamlit!

# SNAPSHOTS

* CHECKING IF WE PLACED CORRECT NUMBER

     a) Green -> If we placed the correct Number
     b) Red -> If we placed the wrong Number
